# Music Quizzer project
Last updated: 5/25/2023

I made this project for fun. It was inspired by the shutdown of Heardle.

Through this project, I had to learn alot about how APIs work and how to code in Javascript (I've done a little bit of JS before but not to this level). Watching youtube tutorials,
I taught myself how to create all the components of the website. While I looked into the source code of other projects, I also did my research to make sure I actually knew what was
going on in the code I borrowed, so that in the future, I would be able to execute these tasks more independently. As my first personal project, I'm proud of the fact that I created a
fully functioning website, just like how I amagined it in my head.
