# Music Tiles project
Last updated: 11/15/2023

This is a project I am working on for fun.

I've always had a passion for video games as well as music so I wanted to test out my abilities to build a small game from scratch.
This project has truly deepened my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I hope you enjoy!

The songs in the game are not original by me. However, they were all arranged by me using SoundTrap.
